    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      At Amarilla Management Ltd, we provide professional services that are
      considered delivered and non-reversible once rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No refunds</strong> will be issued for services that have already
      been provided. By purchasing through our platform, you agree and
      acknowledge that the service begins immediately and is therefore exempt
      from the right of withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe there has been an error or issue with your service, please
      <a href="mailto:amarillamangement@gmail.com">contact us</a> within 7
      days of your transaction. We are committed to resolving genuine concerns
      promptly and fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy is in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws and
      Stripe's requirements.
